# Options
# -------------------------------------------------------
[1] Dell Debloat
* This option quickly applies changes automatically for you. You may review what is being removed, but there is no rollback for this action
[2] Win11-Debloat
* This option makes a web request to https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat. This is an open-source script made for similar purposes, combining functionality
[3] Remove Telemetry
* Windows collects data on users silently in the background (scheduled tasks, registry keys, etc.). These also consumes resources, and may pose as a security risk
