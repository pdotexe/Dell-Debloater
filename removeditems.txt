1. These changes are PERMANENT and cannot be easily reversed without a clean
   Windows installation or system restore point.

2. Some Dell system management tools will be non-functional after removal.
   This is intentional for business laptops that don't require them.

3. Telemetry removal is not 100% complete - some telemetry is baked into 
   the Windows kernel and cannot be disabled.

4. This script is designed for Dell business laptops (XPS, Latitude, etc.) 
   and may affect functionality on other systems.

5. To restore any removed items, you can:
   - Reinstall Windows
   - Restore from a system backup
   - Manually reinstall individual applications from Microsoft Store
